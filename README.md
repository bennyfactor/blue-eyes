## Why this exists
I was looking for a way to build a Sinatra skeleton similar to running

    rails new APP-NAME

[Corneal](http://thebrianemory.github.io/corneal/) was the closest thing I could find and this gem is based largely off of it. It basically does everything equivalent for sinatra that running `rails new` would do, except, it doesn't seem to be maintained anymore, and thus no longer compatible with modern ruby. Thus, I have forked and renamed it, hoping to keep it up-to-date.

## How to start

Install the gem, run `blue-eyes new APP-NAME`, run `bundle install`, and you're all set! You can start up your server with `shotgun` and verify everything is working. It is as simple as that.

It uses a file structure similar to what you would see with Rails.

Directory structure:
```
├── config.ru
├── Gemfile
├── Gemfile.lock
├── Rakefile
├── README
├── app
│   ├── controllers
│   │   └── application_controller.rb
│   ├── models
│   └── views
│       ├── layout.erb
│       └── welcome.erb
├── config
│   ├── initializers
│   └── environment.rb
├── db
│   └── migrate
├── lib
│   └── .gitkeep
└── public
|   ├── images
|   ├── javascripts
|   └── stylesheets
|       └── main.css
└── spec
    ├── application_controller_spec.rb
    └── spec_helper.rb
```


## Installation

    gem install blue-eyes

## Commands
```
blue-eyes -v              # Show blue-eyes version number
blue-eyes help [COMMAND]  # Describe available commands or one specific command
blue-eyes new APP-NAME    # Creates a new Sinatra application
blue-eyes model NAME      # Generate a model
blue-eyes controller NAME # Generate a controller
blue-eyes scaffold NAME   # Generate a model with its associated views and controllers
```
The controller generator also have an optional views flag `--no-views` to create controllers without views.

## Using blue-eyes

To generate your app:

    blue-eyes new APP-NAME

After blue-eyes is done generating your app, run `bundle install` from your app's directory:

    cd APP-NAME
    bundle install

You can then start your server with `rackup`:

    bundle exec rackup

You can generate a model and migration file:

    blue-eyes model NAME

You can also generate an entire MVC structure complete with a migration file:

    blue-eyes scaffold NAME

The resulting structure will look like this:

```
└─app
  ├── controllers
  │   ├──application_controller.rb
  │   └──new_model_controller.rb
  ├── models
  │   └──new_model.rb
  └── views
      ├──new_models
      │  ├──index.html.rb.erb
      │  ├──show.html.rb.erb
      │  ├──new.html.rb.erb
      │  └──edit.html.rb.erb
      ├── layout.erb
      └── welcome.erb
```

You can also add your model attributes when you generate the scaffold structure and have them added to your migration file:

    blue-eyes [model/scaffold] NAME name:string age:integer

```
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.age :integer

      t.timestamps null: false
    end
  end
end
```

Visit [http://localhost:9392/](http://localhost:9392/) to verify your app is running.

You can also verify it is working by running `rspec` to see the passing test:

    1 example, 0 failures
